# Olympics-EDA-ML
This Repo was created for use as a learning tool and discussion starter for a team collaboration time. The code in this repository is an example of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning (ML) models on the Olympics dataset. The dataset contains information about the Olympic Games from 1896 to 2012, including details about the athletes, countries, sports, and events. The code demonstrates how to load, clean, and analyze the data, as well as how to build and evaluate ML models to predict the medal count for countries in the Olympics.a

The Dataset has been sourced from [The Guardian - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/the-guardian/olympic-games). The data should be downloaded and put into the `\Data\` folder.
To run the code in this repository, please follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Zec-Wicks/Olympics-EDA-ML.git
    ```

2. Download the dataset from [The Guardian - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/the-guardian/olympic-games) and save it into the `\Data\` folder of this repository.

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Olympic_EDA_and_ML.ipynb` to explore the code and analysis.

5. Execute the notebook cells to reproduce the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and ML (Machine Learning) models.

6. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different approaches.

7. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.

Happy coding!
